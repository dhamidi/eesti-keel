# What is this?

Anything I learn about the [Estonian language][1] will be documented here.

# File format

The file format for reports is Markdown.  The purpose is to make any texts
easily human readable.  Files are structured in a way that will accomodate
parsing at a later stage.  The exact syntax is going to be developed while
composing the files, because the requirements are not known beforehand.

# Tools

- Lemmatiseerija ("Lemmatizer"):  given any form of a word, it returns
  the dictionary form of that word.

- SÃ¼ntesaator ("Synthesizer"):  given the dictionary form of a word
  and a set of target forms, it returns the word in all target forms.
